# Using SCSS

Part of the beauty of Kemet UI is that you may configure the Core API however you please. Kemet UI acts more like a attribute generator that allows you to layout content. To customize the Core API, you need to work with SCSS directly.

In the following example we're going to customize the name of the breakpoints Kemet UI uses. Checkout the project.

The breakpoints are defined in a SCSS map named `$breakpoints`. The defaults are:

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  tiny: 0,
  small: 321px,
  medium: 768px,
  large: 1024px,
  huge: 1440px
);
```

Notice that in `index.html` we're not using tiny, small, medium, large, or huge. We're using `mobile`. For example.

```html
<div ... kemet-type-size="mobile:plus-3"></div>
```

This is because this app has overwritten the breakpoint map. Since Kemet UI uses [Sass Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use), to overwrite the variables we need to use the `with` keyword.

```scss
@use 'kemet-ui/dist/styles/shared/_config.scss' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    mobile: 0,
    tablet: 768px,
    desktop: 1024px,
  )
);
```

This tells Sass to import the given file with the variables you've defined here instead in the library. You can overwrite any variable you want. To see a full list of configuration variables [checkout the docs](https://storybook.kemet.dev/?path=/docs/styles-config--docs).
