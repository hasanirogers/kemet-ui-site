# Using JSX with Web Components

Popular frameworks such as React and Solid use JSX. The guide will details ways to get TypeScript and your editor to recognize Web Components in JSX.

## The cheap workaround method

A simple method to get Web Components to not error out in JSX is to simply declare an JSX interface with your Web Components using any. For example, create a global declarations file in the root of your project called `declarations.d.ts` and add the following:

```ts
declare namespace JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    'kemet-button': any;
    'kemet-icon': any;
    'kemet-drawer': any;
  }
}
```

This will get any TypeScript errors to go away. But we lose all the autocomplete and API intellisense information.
