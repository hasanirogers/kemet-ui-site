# Light and Dark Mode (Polarity)

Kemet UI ships with the concept of "polarity". This is slightly different from light and dark mode. But it's related. Polarity refers the context of which a component sits on. A "light" polarity means that the component is assumed to be sitting on a light back around. A "dark" polarity means that the component is assumed to be sitting on a dark background.

Kemet UI controls for polarity by adding an attribute of polarity to the &lt;html&gt; tag. This attribute is set to "light" by default. To use "dark mode", set the attribute to "dark".

<br />
```html
<html polarity="dark">
  ...
</html>
```
<br />
You can also use the `polarity` attribute on any element. This will override the `polarity` attribute on the &lt;html&gt; tag.

<br />
```html
<div polarity="dark">
  <kemet-component>
    ...
  </kemet-component>
</div>
```
